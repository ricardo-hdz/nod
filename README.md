# NOD - Nutrition Open Data
Nutrition Open Data is an open-standard format based on JSON to transmit data objects related to the food industry.

With the increasing number of startups and business entities related to the food+tech industry is necessary to start thinking about how to share and track data across the full stack of food production, all the way from harvesting to the table.

The goal for this standard is to define fundamentals: farm and harvesting data, supply chain data, processing data and nutrition data.

## Proposed Standard
